# CertiChain

Hosted on Github Pages https://mhrjdv.github.io/CertiChain/

CertiChain is a decentralized system built on blockchain technology that enables the generation, validation, and verification of tamper-proof digital certificates. The project enhances security, transparency, and trust in the certification process, eliminating the need for a central authority.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for generating digital certificates.
- Blockchain-based storage ensures immutability and integrity of certificates.
- Digital signatures for easy verification of certificate authenticity.
- Front-end developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Back-end developed using Solidity programming language.
- Ethereum blockchain utilized as the underlying framework.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CertiChain.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Deploy the smart contracts on a local or test Ethereum network.
4. Update the contract addresses in the front-end files.
5. Launch the application: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Access the CertiChain application through a web browser.
2. Generate digital certificates by providing the necessary information.
3. Validate certificates by comparing the certificate hash stored on the blockchain.
4. Verify certificates using the associated digital signature on the blockchain.
